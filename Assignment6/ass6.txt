You are encouraged to work in groups for this assignment, but should turn in your own individual work.

a.) Pick some topic modeling software, e.g., one of the following, and get it working:

i. MALLET (Java-based, for Windows, Macs and Linux; requires a Java Runtime on the system):

http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/topics.php (Links to an external site.)

ii. Stanford Topic Modeling Toolbox:

http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tmt/tmt-0.4/ (Links to an external site.)

iii. David Blei's lab:

https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/topicmodeling.html (Links to an external site.)

 iv. One R package:

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/topicmodels/index.html (Links to an external site.)

Note that there are a fair amount of resources on using this software, e.g.:

The Historian's Macroscope  (MALLET & R tutorials):

b.) Pretend you are a social scientist or a humanities scholar and come up with some rough question you want to investigate. Gather a small amount of appropriate data and run the topic modeling software on that data, to learn the models.

 

c.) Investigate the output of the tool and give a brief assessment. Do the topics (i.e., the most frequent words) make sense? Can you see the documents annotated in a way that helps answer your question? Do any mistakes in the output connect with what you know about how the system is working? If you were a non-computer-savvy social scientist, what would have been the most significant barriers to using the software (if any)?

 

Working with MALLET, more or less following the Programming Historian tutorial, or see the MALLET Quick Start (http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/quick-start.php (Links to an external site.)):

1. Download .tar.gz  or .zip  le from: http://mallet.cs.umass.edu/download.php

2. Unpack (e.g., tar xvf mallet-2.0.8RC2.tar ) and change directory (e.g., cd mallet-2.0.8BRC2/ )

3. [extra steps for Windows users]

4. ./bin/mallet  shows a bunch of commands

5. Get help  on options: e.g.

./bin/mallet import-dir --help

 6. Import the data:

./bin/mallet import-dir --input sample-data/web/en/  --output tutorial.mallet --keep-sequence --remove-stopwords

 7. Model topics:

/bin/mallet train-topics --input tutorial.mallet --num-topics 20 --output-state topic-state.gz --output-topic-keys tutorial_keys.txt --output-doc-topics tutorial_compostion.txt
